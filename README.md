# Virtual-Mouse

This Python code implements an interactive image viewer with gesture-based controls using OpenCV and a custom hand tracking module.

The viewer captures video from a webcam, allowing users to navigate through a folder of images and interact with them through hand gestures.

This application has the ability to identify and interpret a wide range of gestures. Some examples include swiping left or right to navigate through images, using pointing gestures to highlight specific points, drawing gestures to annotate images with hand-drawn lines, and erasing gestures to remove any annotations.It maintains a real-time display of the current image along with any annotations on the side.

The code offers an engaging and interactive way to view and annotate images, making it suitable for educational presentations or interactive demonstrations. Users can exit the application by pressing the 'q' key.



You have to add Images in present folder but you have to create it.
